Love takes Time
Put Time into my heart
If it is gone
My faith was nowhere
Build my faith up
Put it into your soul
Give back my faith

Else if Time is 1 give back my heart
Else Knock my heart down
Put my heart into your world
Knock my heart down
Put my heart into your life
Give back Love taking your world with Love taking your life

My soul is a bird
Whisper Love taking my soul
